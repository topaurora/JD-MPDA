The above file is the program and dataset for the paper: Joint Distributed Manifold Preserving Domain Adaptation for Drift Compensation in E-nose 

The first dataset is from our lab.  The raw data is shown in the short-term drift dataset.

The second dataset is from Prof. Vergara's group at UCSD. Details can be found in the paper: Chemical gas sensor drift compensation using classifier ensembles. 

The last dataset is from Prof. Zhang's team at Chongqing University. The last dataset is from Prof. Zhang's group at Chongqing University, and the details can be found in the paper: Anti-drift in E-nose: A subspace projection approach with drift reduction.

The calculation of Gc, Gp and Gt in the program is in the calculation.m.
The iterative computation of CDD is in interation.m.
The program reduction.m implements the subspace dimensionality reduction.

Thanks.
